## Offline Connectivity Solution for Expenses Tracker

This document describes the implementation details of the offline-first architecture for the Expenses Tracker application.

### Overview

The application now supports full offline functionality for managing expenses and budgets. Users can perform CRUD operations regardless of connectivity status, and changes will be synchronized when the connection is restored.

### Key Components

1. **ConnectivityService**
   - Monitors network status using Firestore's `snapshotsInSync()` method
   - Provides real-time network status to the UI and other services
   - Handles automatic and manual reconnection attempts
   - Exposes a simple API (`isOnline`, `forceReconnect()`) for other components

2. **BudgetService**
   - Implements offline-first architecture for budget management
   - Caches budget data locally and updates UI immediately
   - Queues budget changes when offline
   - Automatically syncs pending changes when back online
   - Shows appropriate status indicators for pending writes

3. **TransactionService**
   - Manages expense transactions with offline support
   - Queues new transactions when offline
   - Updates local cache immediately for a seamless user experience
   - Batch syncs pending transactions when connection is restored
   - Maintains category breakdowns and monthly totals locally

4. **UI Components**
   - `NetworkStatusIndicator`: Shows current connection status
   - `ConnectionAwareButton`: Provides contextual actions based on connectivity
   - Offline indicators in budget and transaction tabs
   - Pending sync indicators for queued operations

### Firebase Configuration

- Firestore configured with unlimited local cache size
- Persistence enabled for both web and mobile platforms
- Optimized timeouts for better reliability on unstable connections
- Proper error handling for common offline scenarios

### Data Flow for Offline Operations

1. **When Adding a Transaction While Offline:**
   - UI sends transaction to `TransactionService`
   - `TransactionService` detects offline state via `ConnectivityService`
   - Transaction is added to local pending queue
   - Local cached totals and breakdowns are updated immediately
   - UI reflects the change as if it was successful
   - Transaction is marked as "pending sync"
   - When back online, pending transactions are automatically sent to Firestore

2. **When Setting a Budget While Offline:**
   - Budget change is immediately reflected in the UI
   - Change is stored in `_pendingBudget` queue
   - `hasPendingWrite` flag is set to true
   - When connectivity is restored, the pending budget is synchronized
   - UI shows appropriate indicators during the process

### Error Handling

- All network operations have appropriate timeouts
- Error states are clearly communicated to the user
- Failed operations can be retried manually
- Critical errors trigger user-friendly notifications
- Data integrity is maintained across connection status changes

### Testing

To test the offline functionality:
1. Use the app normally while online
2. Put the device in airplane mode or disconnect network
3. Make changes to budgets and add transactions
4. Observe that the UI updates immediately
5. Note the "offline" indicators and pending sync messages
6. Reconnect to the network
7. Verify that all changes sync properly to Firestore

### Implementation Notes

- All Firestore operations have timeout handling
- Local caching is used for immediate feedback
- Clear status indicators show sync state
- Proper cleanup of resources in dispose methods
- Automatic reconnection attempts when network status changes
